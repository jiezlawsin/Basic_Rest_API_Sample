Back-end : Laravel Framework

Front-end : Angular JS
# do:
* composer install
* bower install
* npm and bower install inside 'client' directory
# Server

Service expects the server is in localhost:8000 by php artisan serve
* run grunt serve inside 'client' folder

# 
* can't implement PUT request for update. Can't catch the data from the service. Instead, I use POST request for the update module.
